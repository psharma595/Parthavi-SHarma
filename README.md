Currently pursuing a Machine Learning Analyst diploma at NorQuest College, an industry-aligned program designed to prepare me for the data, AI, and machine learning workforce.
I enjoy working on real-world data problems and leveraging AI to create meaningful insights.
I've worked on projects such as the Hydrogen Vehicle Challenge and am currently involved with Go Auto, applying my knowledge to real-world business and technology challenges.
